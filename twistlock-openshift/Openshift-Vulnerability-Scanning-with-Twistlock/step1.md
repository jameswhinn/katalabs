Before deploying Prisma Cloud to our OpenShift cluster, we must first prepare our enviornment. In this step, we will configure the project and pull required docker images to our image cache ready for installation in step 2. 

**Project** Openshift provide us with the ability to isolate resources into seperate workloads. This gives us many capabilities, such as being able to set up resourse constraints on workloads and establishing clear security boundaries. 

Let's take a look at our current projects:

`oc get projects`{{execute}}

Now let's create a **Namespace** which we'll use to contain our twistlock deployment:

`oc adm new-project twistlock-workshop --node-selector=''`{{execute}}

Great, now check our project was created successfully:

`oc get projects`{{execute}}



Now that our project is created, let's import the neccessary artifacts we need to proceed with our Prisma deployment.
