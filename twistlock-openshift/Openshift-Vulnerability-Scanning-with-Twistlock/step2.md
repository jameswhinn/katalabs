## Twistlock Console Deployment

Prisma Cloud Console uses a PersistentVolumeClaim to store data. There are two ways to provision storage for Console:

- **Dynamic provisioning:** Allocate storage for Console on-demand at deployment time. When generating the Console deployment YAML files with twistcli, specify the name of the storage class with the --storage-class flag. Most customers use dynamic provisioning.

- **Manual provisioning:** Pre-provision a persistent volume for Console, then specify its label when generating the Console deployment YAML files.

For the purpose of this lab we will manually create the persistant volume against local storage.

In this step we will use the **twistcli** to generate the console deployment file. The twistcli tool is bundled with the release tarball which we unpacked in **./twistlock**. 

The **twistcli** tool generates YAML for a ReplicationContoller, and other service configurations, such as a PersistentVolumeClaim, SecurityContextConstraints, and so on. Let's see what options are available in the **twistcli**:
