## Kubernetes API Reference

Every Kubernetes object has an API specification and this specification can be written it down in a YAML file.

In this exercise, we want to create a Pod and first of all, we are going to check the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#pod-v1-core) to check the Pod's full specification.

Kubernetes API Reference provides us with all the specifics to configure Kubernetes objects by yaml files.
