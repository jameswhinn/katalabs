## Deployments

Deployments provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You can describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

A service in Kubernetes is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you donâ€™t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

In this scenario, we will create a Deployment then expose it as a service
